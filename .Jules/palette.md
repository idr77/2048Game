## 2024-05-22 - Swing Menu Accessibility
**Learning:** Swing `JMenu` and `JMenuItem` components do not have default keyboard accessibility. Explicit mnemonics (`setMnemonic`) and accelerators (`setAccelerator`) are required for basic keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Always verify and add mnemonics/accelerators when working with Swing menus to ensure they are accessible to keyboard-only users.
