## 2024-10-24 - [Menu Accelerators vs Game Controls]
**Learning:** In a Swing game, binding single keys (e.g., 'Space') as menu accelerators can hijack global input, potentially breaking other controls (e.g., button activation).
**Action:** Use standard modifier keys (e.g., Ctrl+H) for menu accelerators to ensure safety and accessibility, even if the game provides single-key shortcuts via other mechanisms (like InputMap).
